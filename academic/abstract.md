Title
MORPHA: A Protocol for Non-Verbal Symbolic Communication via Continuous Transformation

Abstract
This paper introduces MORPHA, an open protocol for symbolic communication that operates without text, pictorial representation, or discrete symbols. MORPHA encodes meaning through continuous transformation of form influenced by sound and silence, emphasizing temporal behavior, overlap, and persistence rather than static representation.

Unlike visual languages or notational systems, MORPHA does not seek to transmit propositional information. Instead, it encodes emotional intention, cognitive stance, and relational state through structured transformation. Meaning emerges from dynamic relationships between morphing symbolic forms, resistance to change, interruption, and absence. Silence is treated as a first-class signal that modifies temporal flow and persistence rather than representing null input.

The protocol defines a small set of symbolic families (Anchor, Flow, Fracture, Void, Echo), grammar rules governing continuity and overlap, and constraints that prevent dominance, hierarchy, or fixed interpretation. MORPHA supports both individual and collaborative utterances, enabling shared symbolic fields without identity markers, turn-taking, or linguistic hierarchy.

MORPHA is released as a protocol rather than an implementation, allowing diverse realizations across media including visual systems, sound-responsive environments, and interactive installations. By prioritizing listening, temporal structure, and transformation over representation, MORPHA proposes an alternative model of communication for contexts where language fails to capture lived experience.
