# MORPHA

An open protocol for non-verbal symbolic communication.

MORPHA defines a way to transmit meaning through continuous transformation of form, influenced by sound and silence.

It does not encode information. It encodes how something is held.

## Status
Open protocol — CC0 — no reference implementation required.

## Read the protocol
- [MORPHA specification](./MORPHA.md)
- [Version 0.1](./versions/0.1.md)

## Governance
MORPHA has no central authority. Compatibility is defined by structure, not consensus.

If it feels unclear, it is working.
