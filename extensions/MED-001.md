# MED-001: Variable Font Axes for MORPHA Motion Encoding

**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** Open contribution  
**Created:** 2024  
**Extends:** MORPHA Core Protocol v0.1  
**Affects:** Section 3 (Fundamental Concepts), Section 13 (Compliance)

## Abstract

This extension defines a mapping between MORPHA motion parameters and OpenType variable font axes, enabling continuous transformation of typographic form in response to sound and silence.

Variable fonts preserve MORPHA's core principle: meaning emerges from transformation, not static form.

## 1. Motivation

Traditional fonts are frozen. A glyph is a glyph.

MORPHA requires continuity. Static glyphs violate the protocol.

Variable fonts offer a solution: axes of continuous variation that can be animated, interpolated, and driven by external signals. A variable font can *morph* — hence compatibility.

## 2. Scope

This extension:

- Defines mappings from MORPHA motion parameters to font variation axes
- - Specifies behavioral constraints for compliant implementations
  - - Does NOT define glyph shapes (those remain implementation-specific)
    - - Does NOT require specific typeface designs
     
      - ## 3. Axis Mappings
     
      - ### 3.1 Core Axes
     
      - The following custom axes are defined for MORPHA-compliant variable fonts:
     
      - | MORPHA Parameter | Axis Tag | Range | Default | Behavior |
      - |------------------|----------|-------|---------|----------|
      - | Velocity | `VELO` | 0–1000 | 500 | Higher values increase stroke dynamism and forward lean |
      - | Resistance | `RESI` | 0–1000 | 500 | Higher values increase weight and structural anchoring |
      - | Oscillation | `OSCI` | 0–1000 | 0 | Controls periodic variation in stroke terminals |
      - | Decay | `DECA` | 0–1000 | 0 | Higher values introduce stroke dissolution and fragmentation |
      - | Persistence | `PERS` | 0–1000 | 500 | Controls temporal inertia in axis transitions |
     
      - ### 3.2 Standard Axis Integration
     
      - MORPHA parameters MAY influence standard OpenType axes:
     
      - | Standard Axis | MORPHA Influence |
      - |---------------|------------------|
      - | `wght` (Weight) | Resistance + Energy amplitude |
      - | `wdth` (Width) | Velocity direction |
      - | `slnt` (Slant) | Velocity magnitude |
      - | `ital` (Italic) | Flow symbol presence |
     
      - ### 3.3 Silence Axis
     
      - A special axis encodes absence:
     
      - | Axis Tag | Range | Behavior |
      - |----------|-------|----------|
      - | `SILC` | 0–1000 | Higher values reduce opacity, increase letter-spacing, and slow all other axis transitions |
     
      - Silence MUST NOT map to zero opacity. Absence is presence, not invisibility.
     
      - ## 4. Behavioral Requirements
     
      - ### 4.1 Continuity
     
      - All axis transitions MUST be continuous.
     
      - Implementations MUST interpolate between axis values over time.
     
      - Instantaneous axis changes are forbidden.
     
      - ### 4.2 Energy Mapping
     
      - Audio input MUST bias axis values, not directly set them.
     
      - ```
        axis_value = base_value + (energy_influence * bias_weight)
        ```

        Direct mapping (e.g., amplitude → weight) violates the protocol.

        ### 4.3 Silence Response

        When silence is detected:

        1. `SILC` axis increases gradually
        2. 2. Other axes drift toward defaults at reduced speed
           3. 3. Persistence increases
              4. 4. No axis may snap to a value
                
                 5. ### 4.4 Symbol Family Presets
                
                 6. Each symbol family implies axis tendencies:
                
                 7. | Family | VELO | RESI | OSCI | DECA | PERS |
                 8. |--------|------|------|------|------|------|
                 9. | Anchor | Low | High | Low | Low | High |
                 10. | Flow | High | Low | Medium | Low | Low |
                 11. | Fracture | Variable | Asymmetric | High | Medium | Low |
                 12. | Void | Low | Low | Low | High | High |
                 13. | Echo | Medium | Medium | Low | Medium | High |
                
                 14. These are biases, not requirements.
                
                 15. ## 5. File Format
                
                 16. ### 5.1 Font Requirements
                
                 17. MORPHA-compliant variable fonts MUST:
                
                 18. - Include all five core axes (`VELO`, `RESI`, `OSCI`, `DECA`, `PERS`)
                     - - Include the silence axis (`SILC`)
                       - - Support smooth interpolation across the full axis range
                         - - Function as valid OpenType 1.8+ variable fonts
                          
                           - ### 5.2 Naming Convention
                          
                           - MORPHA-compliant fonts SHOULD include "MORPHA" or "Morpha" in their family name or style name to indicate compatibility.
                          
                           - Example: `MyTypeface-Morpha.ttf`
                          
                           - ### 5.3 Metadata
                          
                           - Fonts MAY include a `name` table entry (nameID 19, Sample Text) containing:
                          
                           - ```
                             MORPHA-compliant variable font. See: morpha-protocol
                             ```

                             ## 6. Implementation Guidance

                             ### 6.1 Rendering Environment

                             The rendering environment is responsible for:

                             - Receiving audio/energy input
                             - - Calculating axis values based on MORPHA motion rules
                               - - Animating axis values continuously over time
                                 - - Respecting silence as signal
                                  
                                   - The font file itself is passive. Motion logic lives in the renderer.
                                  
                                   - ### 6.2 Recommended Update Rate
                                  
                                   - Axis values SHOULD update at minimum 30Hz for perceptible continuity.
                                  
                                   - 60Hz is preferred.
                                  
                                   - ### 6.3 Transition Smoothing
                                  
                                   - All axis changes SHOULD pass through an easing function.
                                  
                                   - Recommended: exponential decay toward target value.
                                  
                                   - ```
                                     current = current + (target - current) * smoothing_factor
                                     ```

                                     Where `smoothing_factor` is typically 0.05–0.15.

                                     ## 7. Non-Compliance

                                     A variable font is NOT MORPHA-compliant if:

                                     - It lacks any of the six required axes
                                     - - It produces discontinuous transitions
                                       - - It treats silence as zero/invisible
                                         - - It maps energy directly to appearance without bias
                                          
                                           - ## 8. Compatibility
                                          
                                           - This extension is backward compatible with MORPHA v0.1.
                                          
                                           - Implementations that do not support variable fonts remain compliant with the core protocol.
                                          
                                           - Variable font support is optional but, when present, must follow this specification.
                                          
                                           - ## 9. Future Considerations
                                          
                                           - - Multi-axis interpolation weighting
                                             - - Per-glyph axis overrides for symbol family encoding
                                               - - Color font (COLR/CPAL) extensions for energy visualization
                                                 - - Audio-reactive axis choreography notation
                                                  
                                                   - ## 10. Closing
                                                  
                                                   - A MORPHA font does not display text.
                                                  
                                                   - It holds text in motion.
                                                  
                                                   - If the letters feel alive, the font is working.
                                                  
                                                   - ---
